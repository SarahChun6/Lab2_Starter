            <p><b>What are meeting minutes for?</b> <br> 
                Meeting minutes are the notes that capture what happened at a meeting! 
                Different than a meeting agenda, it records the decisions made and actions 
                requested by the group. Despite the team, they are not a minute-by-minute 
                record but include the key details that the team will want to know. It's 
                important in meeting minutes to capture information such as decisions made, 
                next steps, action items and who is responsible. 
                <strong><em>Minutes are the record of who was there and what happened. </em></strong>
                They are an important source of information for people who were unable to attend 
                or looking back to reflect on what happened. They're also an incredibly effective  
                tool to notify or remind people of tasks assigned to them or timelines to keep everyone on track.
